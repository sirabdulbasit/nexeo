# Brain Wiki

Written 2026-11-12 by the Brain Wiki session. Owner direction is in §1, his decisions in §5, the build order in §6, pruning in §7 and the state in §8.

## 1. Owner direction (2026-11-12)

Brain has three aspects:

1. **Feed**: where information comes from (email, meetings, WhatsApp, external systems, Suzi).
2. **Wiki**: where the information is stored, organized, related and connected, the way Obsidian builds knowledge.
3. **Think**: thinks and reacts as per the wiki.

The Brain Wiki role owns aspect 2 only. In his words:

- "build wiki who contain entire knowledge of brain"
- "wiki should work like obsidian the way obsidian build the knowledge"
- "everything should be derived through wiki like Actionable items, contacts"

## 2. Boundaries

| Boundary | Feed side | Wiki side | Think side |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feed → Wiki | Fetches the item (email, meeting, message, record) and hands it over once, with its source id | Decides which notes it belongs to, writes or updates them, links them, cites the source | none |
| Wiki → Think | none | Answers "what do we know about X", "what is linked to X", "what is open for X" | Decides what to say or do; writes back only through the same intake as any feed |

The Wiki does not fetch from outside and does not decide what to say or do. Feed and Think do not write notes directly.

## 3. Where the wiki stands today (production, read-only, 2026-11-12)

- About 15,800 rows in `wiki_pages` for 5 users. About 7,900 are `email_message` pages: one page per email, not a note about a person, project or topic.
- 34,009 rows in `wiki_page_links`; 33,785 are type `related`. Only 4 pages carry a `[[link]]` in their text.
- About 5,100 pages have no link in or out.
- People (`persons`, 974 rows), entities (`entities`, 1,109 rows) and action items (`open_items`) are separate tables. Pages are written beside them, not above them.
- **No single door.** About 35 runtime files write `wiki_pages` directly (ingest services, scribe, composer, cognitive engine, contact sync, integrations, routes). About 50 read it directly. `wikiStorageService.upsertPage` exists but most writers bypass it.
- `obsidianVaultService` already exports contacts and eight page types to the user's Google Drive as markdown (export only).

So the boundaries in §2 do not exist in the code yet. That is the first thing to build.

## 4. Target: how the wiki works

- **A note per thing.** Person, company, project, topic, meeting, decision, commitment, instruction. One note per real thing per user (or per tenant for shared notes); duplicates are merged.
- **Sources are cited, not stored as notes.** An email or message is a source row a note points to. It is not a page.
- **Links are in the text** as `[[Title]]`. The link table and backlinks are rebuilt from the text on every write, so the text is the truth.
- **Properties** on each note (type, emails, phones, company, due date, state, owner) are the structured part, the same idea as Obsidian properties.
- **Contacts are derived**: a contact is a person note and its properties.
- **Action items are derived**: an action item is a commitment note (or commitment line in a note) linked to the people and project it concerns, with state in its properties.
- **Upkeep jobs** merge duplicates, link orphans and mark stale notes.
- **The Drive vault** mirrors all of it, so it opens in Obsidian with the graph.

## 5. Owner decisions (2026-11-12)

1. **The wiki is the master.** Contacts and action items are derived from it.
2. **Rebuild is allowed.** Nexeo is still in testing, so the wiki may be rebuilt in the new structure instead of migrating the old pages one by one.
3. **Feed and Think: leave them.** This role does not change the feed code or the thinking code, and does not need to agree anything with them. The wiki is made strong on its own side; the others can move to it later.
4. **Suzi is not involved** in this work.

Because of decision 3, the earlier plan to move the roughly 35 writers and 50 readers behind one door is dropped. The wiki builds its notes itself from what the feeds have already stored.

## 6. Build order

| Step | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The wiki's own store**: `writeNote`, `getNote`, `backlinks` in `src/services/wiki/wikiStore.ts`; `[[link]]` reading in `wikiLinks.ts`. Links are rebuilt from the note text on every write; a link to a missing note waits as unresolved and connects when that note is written; properties merge; sources cited once; private notes never linked across users. | **Built 2026-11-12, not deployed, nothing calls it yet** |
| 2 | **The builder**: a wiki-owned job that reads what the feeds already stored (emails, messages, meetings, existing pages) and writes person, company, project, topic, meeting and commitment notes through `writeNote`, with `[[links]]` between them. Runs as a rebuild first, then daily. | Next |
| 3 | **Contacts derived** from person notes and their properties. | After 2 |
| 4 | **Action items derived** from commitment notes, keeping the one gate agreed 2026-11-12. | After 3 |
| 5 | **Upkeep**: merge duplicates, link orphans, mark stale. | After 2 |
| 6 | **Full vault mirror** to Drive, so it opens in Obsidian with the graph. | After 2 |

No schema change was needed for step 1: notes are rows in `wiki_pages`, links are rows in `wiki_page_links` with `link_type = 'wikilink'`, properties and unresolved links live in `metadata`.

## 7. How the wiki prunes itself

Owner, 2026-11-12: once the wiki is built, this role decides how it keeps pruning itself so junk does not build up. The rules below are the starting position; they are fixed after step 2, when the rebuilt wiki shows what junk actually appears.

**Keep junk out at the door**

- No note per email or message. A source only adds to a note about a person, company, project, topic, meeting or commitment.
- No note for senders nobody answers: newsletters, notifications, no-reply addresses, bulk mail.
- A new note needs a reason to exist: the user wrote to or about it, it appears in two or more sources, or another note links to it.

**Every note carries its own evidence**

- How many sources cite it, how many notes link to it, when a source last touched it, and whether the user wrote or confirmed it.

**Daily upkeep job (step 5)**

| Check | Rule | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Duplicate | Same email, same phone, or same title key within one type | Merged into one note; links and sources move to the survivor |
| Orphan | No links in or out, one source, untouched for 30 days | Archived |
| Stale | No new source for 90 days and nothing open against it | Marked stale; left out of what Think is given by default |
| Empty | No body beyond the title, no properties | Archived |
| Contradiction | Two notes state different facts for the same property | Flagged for the user, never auto-resolved |

**Never pruned**

- A note the user wrote, edited or confirmed.
- A note with an open commitment linked to it.
- Shared (tenant) notes.

**Archive, not delete.** A pruned note is archived and can be restored; deletion needs the owner's yes. The job records each day how many notes it merged, archived and marked stale, so the pruning itself can be checked.

The 30-day and 90-day figures are first guesses, to be set from the rebuilt data.

## 8. State

- **Live:** nothing from this document. Step 1 is code and tests only; no runtime path calls it.
- **Verified for step 1:** `tests/wikiStore.test.ts` and `tests/wikiLinks.test.ts` (10 tests); the read queries were also run read-only against the production database.
- **Not verified:** `writeNote` against the real database (it has only run against the in-memory stand-in). First real write happens in step 2, on one test user.
- **Next step:** step 2, the builder. Start by listing what each feed has stored per user (`feed_events`, email bodies, meeting digests, WhatsApp bodies) and which note types each should produce.
